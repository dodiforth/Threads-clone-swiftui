## Introduction

The aim of this project was to emulate Threads, the new trendy app from Meta. I skillfully combined SwiftUI for the user interface, Firebase for backend functionalities, and Kingfisher for streamlined image loading and caching.

This Threads Clone project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Threads or any associated entities. It is created for educational purposes and as a demonstration of SwiftUI and Firebase integration.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate their accounts.
- Thread Creation: Create threads to start discussions on various topics.
- User Profiles: View user profiles and see their activity history.
- Real-time Updates: Enjoy real-time updates when new threads or posts are created.
